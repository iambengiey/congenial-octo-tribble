Always obtain official briefings from SAWS/ATC and official AIP/NOTAM sources. Aircraft performance must be based on the POH/AFM.

Computed values (density altitude, TAS, wind components, hypoxia indices) are simplified training approximations.

Workload and stability scores are **training aids only** and must not be interpreted as operational go/no-go decisions.
